# Covid-19-Contact-Tracing-System-Web-App-with-QR-Code-Scanning-using-PHP
This project was inspired in the LGU's Contact Tracking System here in the Philippines. The Contact Tracing System logs all individuals that are visiting a certain establishment. The system has 2 sides of the user interface which are the Admin Panel and the Establishments Log's Side. The Admin Panel is the module of the project which are the system administrator will manage all the data such as the list of establishments and Individuals List. The system automatically generates a printable CTS QR Code Card (Contact Tracing System Quick Response Code Card) and this card will be the identification of the individuals for entering the establishment. Talking about the Establishment Log's Side, each establishment that is registered in the system will a system-generated code which will be used by the establishment's staff to access the QR Code Scanning Feature. This module has only a single page after login because this side purpose is only to log the visitor's QR Code to log their information to the system that the certain individual has entered to the certain establishment in a certain time and date. This project also generates printable reports
